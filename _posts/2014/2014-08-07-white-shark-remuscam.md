When I find some cool YouTube or Vimeo video, I normally just share it on social networks. This time I've made an exception. The footage of this video is _absolutely amazing_.

Scientist have created a special SharkCam, with five high resolution cameras mounted in such a way that it was possible to have a good view of everything around the device. The idea was to take footage of the [great white shark](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_white_shark). Well... they did, but not quite as they prevented. The shark, in fact, attacked the camera. My most sincere congratulations to the armour designer: [a great white bite is thought to exerts a pressure of around 28*10^6 Pa (280 atm)](https://faculty.washington.edu/fishguy/Resources/Research_PDFs/2008-great-white-shark-jaw-bite.pdf), and the REMUS went out of it with a few scratches. The attack pattern is similar to those applied against seals: hide in deep water, target the prey from below, then quickly attack the posterior part to cripple the most powerful fins and drop to zero any escape change.

A suggestion, if I may: what about a pressure sensor on the most bitten areas? So that we give a real answer to the bite pressure thing, that so far has only been simulated.
