# Short bio

I am a Computer Engineer, and a postdoc at University of Bologna. I got my PhD, my master and my bachelor at the same university, but I traveled quite a lot in the meanwile: I had been spending three months at the [Florida Institute of Technology][FIT] in Melbourne (FL, USA) while studying for my master, three months at the [Johannes Kepler Universität][JKU] in Linz (Austria), and finally three months at [Raytheon BBN Technologies][BBN], which included a few weeks of work at the [University of Iowa][UIowa].

My current goal is to become a valuable member of the scientific community.

I like to read, experiment and create during my free time, and that's also why I want a place where to store my thoughts: there is a small but not-zero probability that they could be of use to someone else, or more probably to me in a while, when I'll need to remember why some stuff was done like it is.

Depending on the target of my posts, they might be written in English or Italian. Consider this a bilingual blog.
